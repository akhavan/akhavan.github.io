          <div class="clearfix"></div>
          <p>Reza is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. Reza is like fight club. We don't talk about fight club. Reza's contribution to iAcquire had profound and long lasting effects. If I had my way, I would chain Reza to a chair in front of a computer, and his only food would be the code of the powerful software he writes. Needless to say - Reza is master in the art of web development and its practicality and use in digital business.</p>

        <div class="item">
          <h3>Jeffrey Nappi <small>Director of Technology at iAcquire</small></h3>
          <div class="clearfix"></div>
          <p>Reza is an exceptionally knowledgeable hacker. He's a grand-master web hacker. Reza knows how to tightly integrate business concepts and web development like no one else I have ever met. He has a deep knowledge of what the requirements of business are and how to make them a reality with his skills. Reza has gone full force into JavaScript development and has adopted it as his weapon of choice and wields it with extreme accuracy!</p>

          <h3>Sam Ingrassia <small>Software Engineer at MixRank</small></h3>
          <div class="clearfix"></div>
          <p>Let me first start out by saying that Reza is one of the most gifted software engineers I have ever met. His skill-set and depth of knowledge of the web from design, marketing to software make him a rare individual indeed. Reza is also a great teacher and he definitely strives to educate his employees and clients. Interacting with Reza is always a pleasure and after working side by side with him for almost 3.5 years I have found him to be incredibly hard working and a very clever problem solver.</p>
